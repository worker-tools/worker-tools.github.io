Worker Tools currently doesn't have TodoMVC or similar demo projects, 
but it has two service running in the wild that are Open Source and can be used for reference.

[ghuc.cc](./_projects/ghuc.md) is a simple, single-file web service that is good for a first look at Worker Tools, while
[Worker News](./_projects/worker-news.md) is a slightly more complex app.

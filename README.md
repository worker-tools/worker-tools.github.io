# Worker Tools

* Table of Contents
{:toc .large-only}

Worker Tools are a collection of TypeScript libraries for writing web servers in [Worker Environments][1]{:.external} such as Cloudflare Workers.

[1]: https://workers.js.org/
[2]: https://www.npmjs.com/org/worker-tools
[3]: https://github.com/worker-tools  

## Tools
Workers Tools accomplish many of the same goals as a web framework, but they are provided as standalone libraries.

All modules are written in TypeScript and provide full type declarations and source maps for the best developer experience (tested in VSCode).

Most have no dependencies beyond what is provided by a [Worker Environment][1]. 
For those that have dependencies, only such that provide ES module exports are used. 
This makes it possible to use them without a bundler (browser, Deno) using either UNPKG's [`?module`](https://unpkg.com/#query-params)  parameter or [Skypack](https://skypack.dev). E.g.:

```ts
import { html } from 'https://unpkg.com/@worker-tools/html?module';
/* --- or --- */
import { html } from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/@worker-tools/html?dts';
```

### [HTML Templating](https://github.com/worker-tools/html)
HTML templating and streaming response library.

```ts
import { html, HTMLResponse } from '@worker-tools/html';
self.addEventListener('fetch', event => event.respondWith(
  new HTMLResponse(html`<html><body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <ul>${['Foo', 'Bar', 'Baz'].map(x => html`<li>${x}</li>`)}</ul>
  </body></html>`);
));
```

### [JSON Fetch](https://github.com/worker-tools/json-fetch)
A drop-in replacements for `fetch`, `Request`, and `Response` with first class support for JSON objects.

```ts
import { JSONRequest } from '@worker-tools/json-fetch';
const body = { json: 'data' };
const response = await fetch(new JSONRequest('/api', { method: 'POST', body }));
```

### [Response Creators](https://github.com/worker-tools/response-creators)
A collection of factory functions for Fetch API `Response`s with pre-filled status and status-text headers

```ts
import { ok } from '@worker-tools/response-creators'
self.addEventListener('fetch', event => event.respondWith(ok()))
```


### [Request Cookie Store](https://github.com/worker-tools/request-cookie-store)
An implementation of the Cookie Store API for use within request handlers.

```ts
import { RequestCookieStore } from '@worker-tools/request-cookie-store';
const example = new Request('/', { headers: { 'cookie': 'foo=bar; fizz=buzz' } });
const cookieStore = new RequestCookieStore(example);
```

### [Signed Cookie Store](https://github.com/worker-tools/signed-cookie-store)
An implementation of the Cookie Store API that transparently signs cookies via Web Cryptography API.

```ts
import { SignedCookieStore } from '@worker-tools/signed-cookie-store';
const key = await SignedCookieStore.deriveKey({ secret: 'Password123' });
const sigCookieStore = new SignedCookieStore(cookieStore, key);
await sigCookieStore.set('foo', 'bar');
```

It accepts any Cookie Store implementation, but it's mostly meant to be used with [Request Cookie Store](#request-cookie-store).


### [Encrypted Cookie Store](https://github.com/worker-tools/encrypted-cookie-store)
An implementation of the Cookie Store API that transparently encrypted cookie values via Web Cryptography API.

```ts
import { EncryptedCookieStore } from '@worker-tools/encrypted-cookie-store';
const key = await EncryptedCookieStore.deriveKey({ secret: 'Password123' });
const encCookieStore = new EncryptedCookieStore(cookieStore, key);
await encCookieStore.set('foo', 'bar');
```

It accepts any Cookie Store implementation, but it's mostly meant to be used with [Request Cookie Store](#request-cookie-store).


### [Routing](https://github.com/worker-tools/router)
Worker Tools currently only provides a placeholder for a future routing solution.

In the meantime, here are some alternatives:

- [Tiny Request Router](https://github.com/berstend/tiny-request-router).
  Highly recommended. It might be a little too tiny for many usecases, but it is a good starting point.
  Fully typed!
  
- [Workbox Routing](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-routing).
  A routing solution for Service Workers made by Google. I haven't tried to personally, but it shoud work in Cloudflare Workers as well.


### [Middleware](https://github.com/worker-tools/middleware)
Worker Tools currently only provides a placeholder for a future middleware solution.

In the meantime, here is a TypeScript-safe pattern you can use. The goal is the let developers write close-to vanilla request handlers (as outlinded in various Cloudflare Workers tutorials, i.e. `(event: FetchEvent) => Promise<Response>`), while letting the middleware enhance them in various ways. 

```ts
// Only requirement for developers is that they provde the fetch `event` as a field in a record
export type BaseArg = { event: FetchEvent };

// Our example middleware will add a `cookieStore` field to the argument
export type CookiesArgs = { cookieStore: CookieStore };
export type CookiesHandler<A extends BaseArg> = (args: A & CookiesArgs) => Promise<Response>;

export interface CookiesOptions { /* user-provided options for middleware */}
```

This is the actual middleware: A function that wraps the original request handler:

```ts
export const cookiesMiddleware = (opts: CookiesOptions = {}) => 
  <A extends BaseArg>(handler: CookiesHandler<A>) => 
    async (args: A) => {
      // Do work before
      const cookieStore = new RequestCookieStore(args.event.request);
      
      // Invoke user handler (with augemented args)
      const response = await handler({ ...args, cookieStore });
      
      // Do work after
      const { body, status, statusText, headers } = response;
      return new Response(body, { 
        status, statusText, headers: [...headers, ...cookieStore.headers],
      });
    };
```

#### Usage
What's good about this pattern is that all the weird type-foo goes into the middleware itself. Developers, for the most part, needn't
concern themselves with types. Their editor just "magicially" picks up the correct types for `event`  and `cookieStore`. 


```ts
self.addEventListener('fetch', event => event.respondWith(handleEvent({ event })))

const handleEvent = cookiesMiddleware(/* no opts */)(async ({ event, cookieStore }) => {
  const hello = (await cookieStore.get('hello'))?.value;
  await cookieStore.set('hello', 'Hello Cookie!');
  return new Response(hello ?? 'Reload page!');
});
```

Because the middleware is written in a defensive way (`<A extends BaseArg>`), middlewares can be mixed and matched.
For example, the following works assuming `myOtherMiddleware` follows the the same pattern as `cookieMiddleware`:

```ts
self.addEventListener('fetch', event => event.respondWith(handleEvent({ event })))

// We can separate the options application:
const withCookies = cookiesMiddleware()
const withOther = myOtherMiddleware();

const handleEvent = withCookies(withOther(async ({ event, cookieStore }) => {
  return new Response('Hello World!');
}));
```

#### Limitations
Unfortunately, this pattern isn't perfect: Adding an extra field (without creating a seaprate middleware) requires specifying type paramters by the user:

```ts
self.addEventListener('fetch', event => event.respondWith(handleEvent({
  event, 
  url: new URL(event.request.url), // an additional field...
})));

const withCookies = cookiesMiddleware();
const withOther = myOtherMiddleware();

// ...needs to be specified here:
const handleEvent = withCookies<BaseArg & { url: URL }>(withOther(async ({ event, url, cookieStore }) => {
  return new Response('Hello World!');
}));
```

There's also no easy way to pre-combine multipe middlewares, without creating a new middleware itself
â€” which requires a lot of type-specification and generics to get right.

For these reasons, this remains a placeholder repo for now. Perhaps these quircks can be worked out and made more user-friendly in the future.
